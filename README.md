# Calc10
My first calculator, coded in C# and WPF. Made with happiness (and pain too).




## Standard Calculator
The standard calculator is pretty straight forward, just to mention that `Erase (C)` button is bind to `C` and the `Erase All (CE)` button is bind to `E`.

## Date Calcul
This tab lets you get the difference between two dates, in Year/Month/Week/Day and total days, and it also allows you to add or substract days, months and years to a date.

## Minimal Mode
The minimal is a great addition, when enabled, it creates a little window with a special textbox inside. What's so special about this textbox you'd ask ? The power of this textbox is that it accepts and clcualte expression like `1 + 2^2` directly typed in it. Allowed symbols are : `+ - * / , ( ) ^`.

## Settings
In *Calc10*, you can actually change the theme and the accent color. Those settings are saved in `AppData\Local\Calc10\Settings.ini` but you shouldn't need to go there. To use the custom accent color option, you'll need a ARGB Hex code, made of a # and 8 characters after, example `#FF008FFF`.
